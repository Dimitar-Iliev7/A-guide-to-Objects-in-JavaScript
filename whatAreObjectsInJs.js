// Objects in JavaScript refer to a group of properties.
//  Properties consist of key-value pairs, where the key is represented by a string,
// and the value can be of any data type, including another object.
//  In JavaScript almost anything can be treated as an object, and each object can contain properties with values.
//  In simple terms, objects are like Rockstar's of JavaScript
//  - they come in style, save the day, and organize your data like a boss.

// Letâ€™s consider the example below:

// object literals syntax
const actionHero = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 35,
  country: "USA",
  bike: "Harley Davidson",
};

// In this example, actionHero is an object with five properties and values.

// In this example, mercedes is an object with five properties and values.
const mercedes = {
  model: "s class",
  year: 2020,
  tires: 4,
  seats: 5,
  color: "black",
};

const house = {
  rooms: 4,
  floors: 3,
  kitchen: 1,
  bathroom: 2,
};
