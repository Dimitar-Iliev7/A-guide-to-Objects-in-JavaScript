// Objects in JavaScript refer to a group of properties.
//  Properties consist of key-value pairs, where the key is represented by a string,
// and the value can be of any data type, including another object.
//  In JavaScript almost anything can be treated as an object, and each object can contain properties with values.
//  In simple terms, objects are like Rockstar's of JavaScript
//  - they come in style, save the day, and organize your data like a boss.
